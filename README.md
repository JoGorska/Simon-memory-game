## Deployment

 The site was deployed to GitHub pages. 
 
 * The steps to deploy are as follows: 

  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab; 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch;
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

The live link can be found [here](https://jogorska.github.io/garage-bootstrap/).

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository you will be able to make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JoGorska/garage-bootstrap)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/JoGorska/garage-bootstrap)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JoGorska/garage-bootstrap
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
